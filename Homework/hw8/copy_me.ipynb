If you decide to optimize the geometry of all the molecules in the Solubility datasets, ot will take at least 12 hours. Make sure to save the result so that you don't have to compute it multiple times!\n",
    "<li> You should probably have another separate notebook that creates the graph version of the dataset. Again, you should save the data, and for this make use to use the save_graph and load_graph functions of DGL.\n",
